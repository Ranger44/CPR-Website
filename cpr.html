		//scroll through factoids every few seconds
			//Each year, more than 350,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States
			//CPR, especially if performed in the first few minutes of cardiac arrest, can double or triple a personâ€™s chance of survival.
			//If you are called on to give CPR in an emergency, you will most likely be trying to save the life of someone you love: a child, a spouse, a parent or a friend. 70 percent of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests happen in homes. Unfortunately, only about 46% of people who experience an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest get the immediate help that they need before professional help arrives.
			//First aid is everyone's responsibility. (band-aid)
			//To be prepared to react confidently and without wasting time in either a life-threatening situation or a minor accident, we suggest you keep emergency telephone numbers on hand so that they are available for immediate use. It is also important that you keep your medical supplies in a safe and convenient place where you can find them when needed. Remember, it is important to remain calm and use common sense in any emergency situation.(band-aid)
